            'body' => '<p>The best time to invest in Africa is now; it is however disheartening that foreign investors have not move into the continent, as quickly as expected because foreign investment decisions are often methodically over structured. According to the chief economist of the UN development programme (UNDP) regional bureau for Africa, Dr. Ayodele Odusola, one of the major factors cited is too much risk. But risk and profits are inseparable twins: high- risk ventures are frequently associated with higher profits.&nbsp;</p><p>How are some of the reasons why you should invest in Africa now?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IMPROVED ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECTS:</strong></p><p>Africa’s economic growth prospects are among the world brightest. Six of the world’s 12 fastest growing economics are in Africa <strong>(Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Coto d’ivoire</strong>, <strong>Mozambique, Tanzania and Rwanda)</strong>. Africa as an emerging economy is much more vulnerable to rapid growth and expansion than any continent in the world. Africa’s economy is rising and is expected to double by <strong>2050.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LARGE MARKET:</strong></p><p>With over a billion people, Africa indeed has a very large market. Products sell faster than it does in other continents because the need and demand for such products are very high. With the growth of Africa’ middle class; there are developments of new expectations. There are increased consumption among the educated, urban professionals who are young, brand-aware and sophisticated in terms of their consumption. Africa’s local industries are yet to meet up with Africa’s rising consumption demands and this calls for increased investment. African consumers and businesses spend a total of $4 trillion in <strong>2017.</strong> This figure is expected to rise to <strong>$5.6 trillion</strong> by <strong>2025&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>$6.7 trillion</strong> by <strong>2030&nbsp;</strong>according to world economic forum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Africa is the most profitable region in the world. A report by the U.N conference on Trade and Development states that between <strong>2006</strong> and <strong>2011</strong>, Africa has the highest rate of return on inflows of Foreign Direct Investment: <strong>11.4%.</strong> This is compared to <strong>9.1%</strong> in Asia, <strong>8.9%</strong> in Latin America and the Caribbean. The global figure is <strong>7.1%,</strong> Return Rates are bolstered by significant growth in the region. According to the World Bank, the rate of return on foreign investment is higher in Africa than any other developing region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>YOUNG AND GROWING POPULATIONS:</strong></p><p>Compared to other regions of the world, Africa has a much younger median age. According to Deloitte, 200 million Africans, about 20% of the population, are between the ages of 15 and 24, a figure expected to rise to 321 million by 2030. While the rest of the world is aging, Africa is young. Africa’s young demographics points to economics strength, in that working-age population is associated with favorable rates of GDP growth. This may lead to labour being&nbsp; cheaper in Africa than anywhere else in the nearest future. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION:</strong></p><p>Increased internet access has spurred the diversification of many African economics beyond commodities. This has boosted E-commerce across the region. It is reported that by <strong>2025</strong>, online shopping could account for <strong>10%</strong> of retail sales on the continent, amounting to some <strong>$75</strong></p><p>Billion. The digital transformation of Africa provides huge opportunity for investors to maximize. Africa leads the world in mobile adoption which continues to offer the biggest cross-sectored economic opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed Africa is rising and so is its economy. If there should be a time to invest in Africa: the best time is now.</p>',

            'body' => '<p>The earth is being marched upon by over 7 billion people, a number which is over 200% of its inhabitants in a century past. Excellence and distinctions are micro – factors in being distinguished among the verse people of the earth. These two however are products of self – determination in a good platform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHAT IS SELF DETERMINATION?</strong></p><p>According to IABC Africa, self determination is the art of wheeling self intently or intentionally towards a desired goal or goals, which are presumed primal for self – distinction. It is the ability to keep self focused on a matter until the desired result is attained. It is a virtue that can be cultivated, built and developed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW TO BUILD OR DEVELOP SELF DETERMINATION:</strong></p><p>Self-determination is a personally developed virtue with key interest in attaining and sustaining a desired result, for as much long as possible. Some of the ways to develop self determinations are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PLANNING:</strong></p><p>Wheeling one towards a desired goal requires frequent planning and re-planning. To ensure one is focused on a matter, one must draw out (either in writing or in the mind) an active plan which must include what goals to pursue, relevant sequence in attaining the goal, how to participate in each of the sequence, efficient ways to arrive at the goal on time and the cost and benefits of keeping focused on the matter proper. Planning boost determination as we go along the way of success. It is one thing that can keep the feet on ground when failure keeps showing up at the end of the day. Like in the case of Michael Faraday, a self determination to excel entails not planning to give up even when the results are unfavorable. It is the desire to see your goals come alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DISCIPLINE:</strong></p><p>Discipline is keeping to what should be kept to and leaving out all else. It is the practice of sticking to plan without distractions. Discipline is shying away from distractions in a bid to accomplish a goal or set of goals. To intently move oneself towards a goal, one must be discipline to keep to what it takes to achieve the goal. Discipline entails focus. It is one of macro – factors in distinguishing among men in various field of life. Your level of discipline to attend to a matter will reflect in the result. Discipline is avoiding distractions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EVALUATION:</strong></p><p>Constant evaluation is a key element in developing self determination. Evaluation looks at: why one is at where he is at the moment; How to move forward; Better, efficient and energy conserving ways to attaining similar results (if positive) as one have now; and possible outcomes of next trials. The reason for evaluation is that one can be easily discouraged and hence lose determination if one did not measure the progress made so far, the distance to the require result and what is left to be done to achieve it. Once a proper evaluation is done, ones zeal and determination can be rekindled to achieve greatness by attaining goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PERSISTENCE:</strong></p><p>This is lack of willingness to give up on a goal. It is a self – prompted resistance to opposition and insistence on a breakthrough or favorable result. Like in wheel, one’s desire to move towards a direction must be fueled by a pushing force which must excel above any opposing force. The inability of the wheel to excel above the opposing forces keeps it stagnant or pushes it further backward as the case may be. Persistence is the fuel for self – distinction, without it the fight for self – determination has been lost. To persist means to be resilient, to linger a while in pushing towards a goal expecting a favorable result despite growing obstacles or previous challenges. The ability to persist is one key element that makes men to excel in life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, because obstacles exist, self-determination is a key element for achieving success and distinguishing self among others in a particular field. As a virtue, self- determination is the quest to excel in any line of duty, one assigned to oneself.</p>',

When the needful are not done, things may go wrong that may affect the life span of the business. In Africa, this is also the case as many businesses get ruined from the word \'go\'. There are several dos and don\'ts to reflect on while setting up an African Business, some of which are:</p><h2>The DOs</h2><p><strong>1. Understand the \'WHYs\'&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Understanding the reason for setting up a business can be very vital in sustaining it and enforcing its existence over time. The \'WHYs\' are the reason for setting up the business in the first place. Though businesses grow to diversify into other businesses for various other reasons, the purpose of setting up the business should be primal in any consideration with regards to anything that concerns the business. Businesses exist to solve problems, for its existence to be sustained, it must learn to solve these problems effectively and efficiently. Whether it be for profit or for non-profit, the reason for creating the business should be well established.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Do market research.</strong></p><p>Start researching about the composition of the market, the market size and&nbsp;your potential rivals or partners within the market.&nbsp;For example, you can conduct interviews by telephone or face to face. You can also offer surveys or questionnaires that ask questions like “What factors do you consider when purchasing this product or service?” and “What areas would you suggest for improvement?”</p><p><strong>3. Build a Team</strong></p><p>A team&nbsp;is made up of two or more people who work together to achieve a common goal. In business, organizing in&nbsp;teams&nbsp;allows a company to benefit from the skills and perspectives of employees from different parts of the organization. Creativity thrives when people work together on a team. This helps to blend&nbsp;complementary strengths and builds trust.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Know your Partners</strong></p><p>Before the business fully kicks off, get to know your partner - their previous engagements if any, why they want to be in the business, their percentage contributions and revenue sharing formula.&nbsp;If you start your company with co-founders, you must agree early on about the details of your relationship. Not doing so can potentially cause enormous problems down the road.This will help put you at ease and prepare you for the bulk of the work ahead.</p><p><strong>5.

Some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world capitalize on opportunities in emerging markets to grow their businesses into globally recognized brands.</p><p>If there is any time to start up an enterprise, to negotiate a life pattern or to strike forth for a worthy living, it is at the prime of one\'s youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BENEFITS OF STARTING UP YOUNG!</strong></p><p><strong>1) IGNITE CHANGE</strong></p><p>Most times, we all&nbsp;want to see change - change in the way things are done, a departure from the conventional. But it is hard to effect a change at old age. To see the change we desire happen in our life time, we need to start up young.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2) IMPROVED PASSION</strong></p><p>Youth is synonymous with passion. Pure passion drives you to put in the long hours and burn the midnight oil effect the change you want to see.

            'body' => '<p>Mentoring&nbsp;is most often defined as a professional relationship in which an experienced person (the&nbsp;mentor) supports and encourages people to develop specific skills and knowledge that will maximise their business&nbsp;potential and improve their performance. &nbsp;A&nbsp;business mentor provides a confidential sounding board, thinking room, and support for working through crucial and often complex decisions.</p><p>A mentor should be someone who is in the same or a similar industry as you, but further along in their career. He/she is&nbsp;someone with more entrepreneurial business experience than you, who serves as a trusted confidante over an extended period of time, usually free of charge.&nbsp; Because they have a greater body of knowledge and experience, they are able to teach you invaluable lessons that you’d otherwise have to learn the hard way.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Miranda Morley, “Would-be successful business owners need assistance from others who have an intimate knowledge of how business works. Many small business owners try to get that information from business books and classes. While these can be helpful on their own, they are more helpful alongside business mentoring. In a business mentoring relationship, a seasoned business owner meets with a new or potential business owner one-on-one to give advice and boost morale.”</p><p>Here are six benefits of having a mentor:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gain experience not usually shared in books.</strong></p><p>Chances are, your mentor\'s been exactly where you are right now. They may have also made plenty of mistakes along the way, which you naturally hear about as you two meet or share insights in whatever way. They\'ve been there, done that and have seen it all.</p><p>&nbsp; “Experience is a very expensive asset -- yet it\'s crucial to business success. There\'s only so much about a&nbsp;person\'s experience you can gain from books. It\'s an unstated truth that most authors do not feel comfortable revealing everything about themselves in books. Some personal experiences may be too intimate to be shared, yet how they dealt with it can help an inexperienced entrepreneur\'s career”, says Sheila Eugenio, a guest writer at Entrepreneur magazine</p><p>Mentorship is one guaranteed way to gain experience from others who have gone ahead of you and avoid the mistakes they made in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Network opportunities</strong></p><p>Business mentors can put you in touch with contacts who can help you make your business more successful. They can be an incredible asset when it comes to professional networking.&nbsp;Finding a mentor who you aspire to be like, within your chosen profession also helps you add to your network. It’s highly likely that should your mentor not have the answer to a question or problem, they should know someone who will. They can introduce you to like-minded people and some of these could be valuable connections throughout your career.&nbsp;</p><p>A successful mentor has an unlimited network of people who can benefit your career. Since they are already invested in your success, it only makes sense for them to let you tap into their network of people when the need arises. Building a network of influential people who you can call on and that add value to your experiences is a great way to continue your own personal development. Talking through things with people more experienced than yourself can help you to learn and grow quicker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>They help you focus</strong></p><p>It’s all too easy to get distracted these days so having someone to help you stay on track and focus your attention on the important things will help you maintain your personal growth and smash your professional targets. &nbsp;Motivation can be a hard thing to manufacture but telling your mentor you’re going to achieve something and setting yourself a goal means you have someone to hold you accountable to these goals. This means you’re more likely to take action and will therefore see results quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Confidence to Make Better Decisions</strong></p><p>“Knowing that you have a credible mentor to turn to can give you confidence when facing difficult business situations. Similarly, good mentors will praise you when you have made good decisions. Praise can enable you to see yourself as a wise and experienced business person. Seeing yourself confidently this way will help you stand your ground when you must defend or stand by your business decisions”, says Miranda Morley.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Perspectives</strong></p><p>They can offer you impartial advice from a professional point of view, which may help you see opportunities and challenges from a more constructive perspective. Business mentors can help you look at problems and situations from perspectives that you would not have thought of on your own</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Improving Key Skills</strong></p><p>Business mentors help you develop your business skills. They helped you to identify and correct gaps in generic skills and knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>Other benefits include&nbsp;<strong>a mentor will help you stay in business longer, encouragement, personal development and feedback.</strong></p>',

            'body' => '<p>Without any doubts, the <strong>African Business Environment</strong> is one of the fastest growing markets across the world, and it attracts lots of Foreign Direct Investment, particularly in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you are willing to <strong>invest in Africa</strong>, it is imperative you understand some key things about the emerging market so as to be able to make informed decisions and make the most of your investment in the region.</p><p>So, what are these things you need to know about?</p><p>They are listed below:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. AFRICA IS MADE UP OF 54 YOUNG AND THRIVING MARKETS</strong></p><p>Africa is not a single market; it has more than 50 countries spread over a land mass that is larger than the USA, India, China, Japan, and all of Europe…combined! If you intend to invest in Africa, it is much more important for you to understand the key differences among these markets as they will be helpful to you in making sound financial and investment decisions. There is also a need to understand market growth patterns, as there are some African markets which are not large or dynamic enough or have an enormous risk potential. Some of the key factors to consider include investment climate and protection, governance, infrastructure, and if possible available exit strategies for larger investments. Additionally, it is imperative to gain some insights about key issues like strategic local partnerships, cross border trading, as well as the economic trade regions exciting in the African continent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SPENDING POWER TO MATCH</strong></p><p>In recent times, the African continent has experienced tremendous growth in the number of middle and upper classes bourgeon. However, this rapid growth also comes handy with a huge boost to the purchasing power of the continent’s population.</p><p>According to the World statistics, Africa comprises of over 1.2 billion people, and the World Economic Forum forecasts that the figure will increase to 1.7 billion come 2030. The forum also predicts that the consumer and business spending set would reach a minimum of $6.7 trillion by then. In a similar event, the UN as well opines that sub-Saharan Africa will account for about half the increase in the global work force.</p><p>As a result of this, smart investors are already lobbying to invest their funds in the region with the hope of yielding higher income in the nearest future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. ENORMOUS AND AFFORDABLE RAW MATERIALS</strong></p><p>Africa is enormously blessed with legions of natural resources, and more importantly most of these resources are yet to be exploited. This is why lots of investors are putting more of their funds in the manufacturing industry.</p><p>Additionally, Africa is renowned for her very huge land mass, most of which are yet to be exploited. This therefore creates an ample opportunity for investors to invest their funds into the relevant sectors, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>These enormous lands can be used for large-scale farming, and the good news is that manufacturers need not to import any raw materials as they are readily available and relatively affordable. Again, these most of these lands are very fertile, meaning that it will yield more harvest without any extra efforts or funds.</p><p>However, it is important to note that vast majority of the farmers in this region are being forced to giveaway or sell off their farm produce at relatively low prices due to excess competition at the local market.</p><p>This challenge is really an opportunity in disguise for the potential investors as they will be able to buy most raw materials at a very cheap price.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE GLOBAL AVERAGE</strong></p><p>On the average, the global return on investment (ROI) ranges between 5-10% while that of Africa is a bit higher than that with an estimate of 15-25% ROI. However, there are a number of firms making a whopping 30 – 35% ROI on certain projects right in the land of Africa, meaning the environment is conducive enough for investors with sound plans and strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH</strong></p><p>The whole world is currently experiencing rapid advancement in the technological sector, and the African continent is not left out as well. In fact, vast majority of the countries in this continent are already beginning to realize the enormous opportunities that come with Technology-related sectors, including Telecommunications, internet, general ICT, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>The aforementioned sectors are at their growing stage in Africa, and they are yet to be fully exploited. For instance, most of the businesses operating in this continent are still using the traditional, analogue processes, compared to the potent, digital processes being used in many other continents.</p><p>Fortunately, the ICT sector in Africa has lots of potentials and any smart investment made therein can never go wrong. If you are willing to invest in Africa, then the ICT sector is a very good industry to start with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. WIDE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED,&nbsp;AFFORDABLE LABOR</strong></p><p>There are lots of tertiary institutions in Africa and each of them turns out millions of graduate year in year out. The major issue is that there is wide spread of job scarcity in the region, and most of the graduates are roaming the streets with the hope of getting a good job very soon.&nbsp;</p><p>The high unemployment rate in Africa is what birthed the excessive number of Africans migrating to the foreign countries in a bid to search for greener pastures.&nbsp;</p><p>This increased migration rate clearly shows that the cost of labor in Africa is quite low, especially when compared to some other continents in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>However, smart investors can exploit this opportunity by situating a conglomerate business in this particular region so as to attract and retain vibrant, qualified personnel – even for a relatively affordable cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. RISKS CAN BE MITIGATED TO A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes, emerging markets can be very rewarding at times, yet they also come with greater risks. This is a normal thing to emerging markets, so don’t shy away from the fact! The plain truth is that you tend to face some challenges when investing in emerging markets like Africa, but the good news is that there are certain measures you can take to mitigate the risks to a significant level.&nbsp; To start with, make sure you invest only in less risky African market, don’t choose a volatile industry, seek alliance with reliable local industry partners, and also try adopting a multi-market entry strategy. By so doing, you will be able to make the most of your investment in Africa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THESE FACTORS AND MORE ARE WHAT MAKE THE AFRICAN CONTINENT A VERY GOOD SPOT FOR INTENDING FOREIGN INVESTORS.</strong></p>',

There is no glory in being a local champion. There is no glory in being large without being productive either.</p><p>Where should a startup business channel its focus? Local Market or International Market!&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is – It depends! Let\'s take two striking stories analogically here - The Chinese Bamboo tree and the App developer in the streets of Zimbabwe.</p><p>The story of the Chinese bamboo is a regular motivation for new startup founders. A Chinese bamboo tree, when planted stays under the soil without showing up on the surface of the earth for four years. On the fifth year, however, it springs forth for the first time. After six weeks of springing forth, it grows to about 80 to 90 feet tall. The story of the bamboo tree tells much about patience and persistence. The Chinese bamboo farmer must continue to water the bamboo for four years consecutively even without seeing the offshoot. He must believe in his seed and work persistently to see it come alive. He needs not upturn the ground to check if something is actually happening with his bamboo seed – or, perhaps if it may have been eaten up by the ants or it’s badly damaged by other elements – he needs not to worry about that. He anchors his faith in the potency of his bamboo seed. It will spring forth in the fifth year and for that reason he waits anxiously. In the first four years of the Chinese bamboo’s seedling, it will be busy taking roots - running its rooting system far into the ground and round about itself. The four years period grants it enough space of time to develop a sophisticated root network. In the fifth year, it springs forth for the first time above the earth surface and in the next six weeks, it is about 80 to 90 feet high about the ground - a wonder to all that beholds it at the time. The six weeks’ 90 feet growth came about by the developed strong root system/network.&nbsp;The Chinese Bamboo tree first tries to understand its underground network and how best to fit in and deepens its root system before it aspires to spring forth above the earth surface and beyond bounds. This can be ascribed as analogy for starting within reach (your local community and others), then going beyond bounds (say, international) later.</p><p>On the other hand, lets imagine a Zimbabwe App Developer who just finished acquiring skills on how to develop a financial app. Charged by his business coach ‘to capture them young’, he launched into his local market. After 2 years of trying to get meaningful number of subscribers (apart from his sympathetic friends and relatives) without fruition, he discovered that the reason was that for one to effectively utilize his app, the person actually require a given level of financial literacy which is deficient in his local community in Zimbabwe at the time. Two challenges emerged and began to seek for preeminence, that is, which should come first in dealing with – Solving the financial literacy deficiency in his Zimbabwean community or getting a larger international market for his product which is now market-ready.&nbsp;After considerable deliberations, he was led to partner that same year with a Southern African telecom giant who was wowed by the product and used its far-reaching and already developed network to get the app to where they were actually needed - South Africa. In the next quarter, he’s actually gotten millions of daily users and hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers. In his very words, “The firm’s growth came like in twilight”, he never anticipated it.</p><p>With this achieved, he went back to solve the problem of financial literacy in local community as one of his firm’s corporate social responsibility and thereafter got his product the largest share of the market from his Zimbabwean community. In his words, during an event to the five years anniversary of the firm and to celebrate his philanthropic gestures towards the community, he said, “I would have lost out in the game , if I started fighting for financial literacy here in the community first, but now I have achieved both and in less time.” This is an analogy for going beyond your local market from onset. This also entails wider vision.</p><p>Summarily, stories can be used to buttress points, teach lessons, and inspire people but when it leaves the audience practically aroused and with no definite step(s) to take next in their business journey or vision pursuit, it can be likened to just a motivational talk (like what you have in this post) and not a practical business development expose. After this manner, Zig Ziglar said, motivation is like bathing the more often the better.</p><p>Business development expose are different however, as they seek to provide the audience with practical \'next-step\' and \'step-by-step\' solutions to daily problems. In its delivery, various school of learning emerges; none supersede the other but complement to meet the entrepreneur’s ever rising and evolving desire to provide solutions to societal problems.</p><p>As business coach or mentor, we need not be just open-ended while rendering business lessons like most business coaches of these days in their so-called \'free live video business tips\'. Their goal is to get as many followers as possible but not to replicate themselves. The ultimate aim of a teacher, however, is to replicate himself in his students, that is, to build men who sees things the way he sees them, who react to things he way he will react to them and who takes steps in like manner.</p><p>Every Business leader has his tweaks and unique difference. Some can work comfortably with friends, while others may go for distant fellows. Some [like me] go for long hours with fewer leisure, some strikes for equitable balance. Actually, that’s the flavor of leading – people with similar traits follow. As a business leader, your followers must be able to underpin your possible reaction(s) to each situation they face and try to replicate your supposed response in a bid to deal with their daily business hurdles even with you in absentia.</p><p>A business leader should be very practical, telling the audience why they should do what they do, the result to expect, reasons for digression and disparity in expected results, how to handle them with less ease, with practical ways to solving business daily hurdles. He is never apologetic in his approach nor is he ‘orthordoxly’ dogmatic.</p><p>While it is easy for us to say that foreign modules have not delivered on all of its a priori expectations, we need not strike out completely its preeminence and overall significance in our today’s economy.</p><p>In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with starting or being local, but being or going international is quite extraordinaire and intriguing.</p>',

There is no perfect moment however, if you keep delaying, you may end up putting it off forever.</p><p>If you have ever been contemplating the possibility of starting your own online business online? Now is a great time to stop thinking about it and start taking action. Throughout history, it has probably never been easier to start your own business online. With the&nbsp;development and growth&nbsp;of&nbsp;social media everyone is connected together regardless of their income status or geography.</p><p>Here are five reasons why you should start your online business now:</p><ol><li><strong>Growing Internet Audience</strong></li></ol><p>"The overwhelming ubiquity of the Internet has opened worldwide markets for companies of all sizes. A one-person operation with a website and a presence on social media can reach consumers across the world as easily as the neighbors down the street. People in all countries are exposed to the same news and cultural phenomena, so a popular product or service can easily go viral across borders. Traditional distribution channels are under pressure to expand and eliminate barriers of cost or exclusivity that once existed. In short, an entrepreneur today can sell anything to anybody any place on the globe", says Michael Lewis, a retired corporate executive and entrepreneur.</p><p>Study shows that every day around 1 million people are getting internet access for the first time in their lives. This roughly translates into 11 new internet users every second. So just going by the numbers, the size of your target audience is growing at an insane rate. Billions of new people are going to join the internet in the next few years. Most of these people will become online consumers, shoppers, and searchers.</p><p><strong>2. Access to a worldwide market</strong></p><p>Thomas Smale said that, "The beautiful thing about an online business is the ability to run it 24/7 without boundaries. There are no geographical boundaries and there are no specific hours of operation -- an online business can produce revenue around the clock, even while you sleep.</p><p>With a well thought-out social media plan, search-engine optimization and paid media strategies, an online business can thrive. You have access to the entire world right at your fingertips. The luxury of being able to target specific states, regions and countries gives an upper hand to online-based businesses."</p><p><strong>3. You have the freedom of choosing your location</strong></p><p>According to From Dream to Lifestyle, "In an online business you aren’t tied down to a desk or a single location.</p><p>As long as you have an internet connection and a laptop you can run your business from anywhere in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>You have the freedom to travel and choose where you want to work on any given day and that’s extremely liberating.</p><p>Whether you want to visit your family in another state&nbsp;or take a trip somewhere exotic your business will always be with you."</p><p>4. <strong>There&nbsp;are numerous ways to earn money and diversify your income</strong></p><p>"With rapidly increasing internet and smartphone access around the globe, there are numerous ways you can make money online.</p><p>For example, you can offer skills like software development, graphic design, content writing or virtual assistant services as a freelancer.</p><p>Or if you currently sell products locally, you can exponentially grow your business with an eCommerce website and reach millions of customers around the globe.</p><p>If you can’t manufacture your own products, you can start an eCommerce dropshipping business and potentially make millions of dollars with literally no upfront investment. This infographic explains the dropshipping business model", said Jawad Khan, &nbsp;a freelance writer, professional blogger and marketing consultant.</p><p><strong>5. It No Longer Requires Tech Skills To Launch An Online Business</strong></p><p>According to Mike Cooch, CEO of LVRG, "There are a handful of things you need to be able to do to get a business up and running online:</p><ol><li>Build a ‘home’ for your business – typically a website</li><li>Reach and communicate with your prospects and customers</li><li>Process sales transactions</li></ol><p>All of that used to be really expensive and complicated.</p><p>Now, none of it is.</p><p>Website builders and hosts, all-in-one CRM and Marketing Automation platforms, and ecommerce platforms are now so affordable and ‘point-and-click’ easy to use, that even a technology novice could be up and running with a fully functioning online business within a week."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are the more reasons you shouldnt wait anymore, go launch it Now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

It’s also a place where you can easily generate&nbsp;business, says Syed Balkhi, an entrepreneur, growth hacker, and marketer. When it comes to raising brand awareness and commanding customers’ followership and allegiance, social media play a very vital role.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1164/social-networks/">Statistica</a>, the number of worldwide users on social media platforms (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, etc.) is projected to hit a whopping 3.02 billion active users per month by 2021.

Maintain a Constant Presence</strong></p><p>Maintaining a constant presence on your social media account helps to build a memory of your brand among your audience while keeping them constantly engaged. It takes time and patience to cultivate a reliable presence.</p><p>Nothing destabilizes social media branding efforts more than irregular posting.&nbsp;</p><p>While you should tweet more often and frequently upload new Instagram pictures, you should limit your Facebook and Linkedin posts to once or twice a day.&nbsp;</p><p>Posting irregularly will erase your brand quickly from your audience\'s memory. Shortened attention spans combined with rapidly growing social networks have made constant publishing&nbsp;more important than ever.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://iabcafrica.com/article/3"><strong>7 Smartest Things To Do as a New Startup Business</strong></a></p><p><strong>2. Use Social media to tell your brand story</strong></p><p>Social media provides a great channel to tell your brand story and get connected with your audience.

Hence, you can build relationships over time which will improve the trust level of your customers. It gives you the opportunity to&nbsp;build trust with customers&nbsp;and develop loyal customers.&nbsp;</p><p>People prefer to purchase from brands they recognize. For any small business, raising awareness is a top goal. You can start building awareness for your brand on social media by engaging and interacting with other users by replying to Tweets and comments on Facebook and Instagram posts.</p><p>If you’re not exactly sure where to start when it comes to relationship-building, here are some quick ideas:</p><ul><li>Always, @mention people, you reference in your social media posts</li><li>Answer questions people ask</li><li>Reply when people @mention you or share your content</li><li>Don’t just Retweet and Like other people’s content; reply with a comment&nbsp;to start a conversation.</li></ul><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://iabcafrica.com/article/4"><strong>Starting Up a Business in Africa - The DOs</strong></a></p><p><strong>4.

                'description' => 'If you want to be highly successful, you need to be highly disciplined.',
                'body' => '<p>While it is common to declare a million new goals for the new year only to get burned out a month in, cultivating positive habits can help you achieve more in less time.&nbsp;</p><p>A habit is a settled or regular&nbsp;tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up. Habits over a period of time molds character and character gives birth to destiny. Our daily habit goes a long way to determine the extent to which we will succeed or fail in life. &nbsp;It is therefore important that healthy habits are cultivated in order to have a successful and effective life.&nbsp;</p><p>As we step into a new year and a new decade, here are some habits to cultivate towards achieving success in all endeavors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Get up Early</strong></li></ol><p>Mornings are powerful. One of the core&nbsp;habits&nbsp;of successful people is that they get out of bed early. There’s a reason some of the most successful people in the world have&nbsp;committed morning routines&nbsp;that they never skip. It provides them a sense of confidence to plan things ahead so that they can easily accomplish their daily tasks. Getting up early grants you the ample time to meditate and plan the activities of the entire day while also involving in bodily exercise. Resist the temptation to snooze in the morning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; 2. Meditate</strong></p><p>Meditating calms the mind and boosts focus, allowing you to ease into your day. Meditation has many physical and mental benefits like it removes stress, controls anxiety, boosts self-awareness, etc. Through mindfulness, you are able to approach situations with much more clarity to better focus on what\'s really important and prioritize your time accordingly, both professionally and personally.When you meditate, you also increase your cognitive and creative thinking skills which make you highly efficient in your career.</p><p>Meditation is a powerful habit that trains your mind to relax by freeing it from negative or stressful thoughts.&nbsp; As we launch into the new year, make meditation one of your daily morning/evening routine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Practice Journalling</strong></p><p>The habit of reflective writing, even a short daily passage, can make you more productive.&nbsp;Use your journal to write what you want your life to be and track your achievements as you go. Getting things done on time is important to become successful, that’s why to be successful you should cultivate a habit of keeping your activities in a specific journal so that you can track your daily achievements.</p><p>“Journaling is one of the best methods of self-care therapy. When you\'re journaling consistently, you tend to ask questions about life, your direction,&nbsp;and&nbsp;your business." Says <i>Dr. Stacia Pierce, author of&nbsp;</i>25 Habits of Successful Women.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Read</strong></p><p>Avid readers have a wealth of knowledge and experiences. Schedule time out of your day to read. It can be in the morning while everyone else is sleeping, or maybe part of your nightly routine like mine. Find books you enjoy and learn something new every day. Cultivating a daily&nbsp;reading routine can boost your smartness and set you up for success.&nbsp; You can also&nbsp;read about your industry and beyond to get acquainted with daily happenings in your domain.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Create a 30-day Challenge</strong></p><p>The reason I love creating a 30-day challenge is that it gives me something to strive towards during the duration. I can get myself stretched trying to beat a deadline. The challenge can range from anything — workout challenges, writing challenges, creative challenges. Dedicate yourself to 30 days of something that will put you out of your comfort zone. Stretch your limits and make the challenge something fun to look forward to. You can also tie it into any of your other annual goals by creating a monthly target for each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Limit less-productive time on social media</strong></p><p>Money isn’t the only important resource for wealthy people. Time is crucial too. They are used to spend their time wisely because they know that every day they have a specific amount of time that needs to be spent effectively for being successful.</p><p>While there is plenty of merit in a&nbsp;digital detox, you should delete time-sucking apps that are of no value to you. Also, learn to minimize the time generally spent on your apps daily. Social media can be beneficial if used right.</p><p>Don’t allow yourself to be taken over by the aimless scrolling on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc and be left wondering where the last two hours went.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Practice gratitude</strong></p><p>Cultivate the habit of gratitude at each moment in your life. We all have those days where it feels like nothing is going right. It is better to deal with these feelings by practicing gratitude.&nbsp;Focus on the positive things and recognize the good in your day. Learn to say thanks to the good and the bad. This is key to mental health. &nbsp;A positive and grateful attitude unlocks opportunities for personal and professional growth. Make it a practice to&nbsp;write down three things you are grateful for in the day, three things that had made your day great and give thanks for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. Maintain Positive Relationships</strong></p><p>Successful people make a point to limit their exposure to toxic, negative people. The reason being that you are only as successful as those you frequently associate with. Successful people prefer to develop relationships among positive and motivated people so that they can have the company of the right people. Positive relationships provide you with much-needed support in tough times, and it is the best way to stay strong and optimistic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With these habits in place, you are right on track to make the most out of the new year.</p>',
